## Introduction to Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

### Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled examples (our image classification case)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and rewards

### Image Classification
Image classification is a supervised learning task where we:
1. Train a model on labeled images
2. The model learns to recognize patterns and features
3. Use the trained model to predict labels for new, unseen images

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### Why CNNs for Images?
Traditional neural networks treat images as flat arrays, losing spatial relationships. CNNs preserve spatial structure through:

### Key Components

#### 1. Convolutional Layers
- **Purpose**: Extract features from images using filters/kernels
- **How it works**: Slide small filters across the image to detect patterns
- **Output**: Feature maps highlighting detected patterns

```
Input Image (32x32x3) → Conv2D(32 filters, 3x3) → Feature Maps (32x32x32)
```

#### 2. Activation Functions (ReLU)
- **Purpose**: Introduce non-linearity
- **ReLU**: `f(x) = max(0, x)` - keeps positive values, zeros out negatives
- **Why**: Allows network to learn complex patterns

#### 3. Pooling Layers
- **Purpose**: Reduce spatial dimensions and computational load
- **MaxPooling**: Takes maximum value from each region
- **Effect**: Makes model more robust to small translations

```
Feature Map (32x32) → MaxPool(2x2) → Reduced Map (16x16)
```

#### 4. Flatten Layer
- **Purpose**: Convert 2D feature maps to 1D vector
- **When**: Before connecting to dense layers
- **Example**: (8x8x32) → (2048,)

#### 5. Dense Layers
- **Purpose**: Final classification based on extracted features
- **Fully Connected**: Each neuron connects to all previous layer neurons
- **Output Layer**: 10 neurons for 10 CIFAR-10 classes

#### 6. Softmax Activation
- **Purpose**: Convert raw scores to probabilities
- **Output**: Probabilities sum to 1.0
- **Interpretation**: Confidence in each class prediction

## CIFAR-10 Dataset

### Overview
- **Images**: 60,000 color images (50,000 train, 10,000 test)
- **Size**: 32x32 pixels
- **Classes**: 10 categories
- **Channels**: 3 (RGB)

### Classes
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

### Challenges
- **Low Resolution**: 32x32 pixels contain limited detail
- **Intra-class Variation**: Same class objects look different
- **Inter-class Similarity**: Different classes may look similar
- **Real-world Complexity**: Lighting, angles, occlusion

## Data Preprocessing

### Why Preprocess?
Raw image data needs preparation for optimal model performance.

### Key Steps

#### 1. Normalization
```python
data = data / 255.0  # Scale pixel values from [0,255] to [0,1]
```
- **Purpose**: Standardize input range
- **Benefit**: Faster convergence, stable training

#### 2. One-Hot Encoding
```python
# Convert: 3 → [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
```
- **Purpose**: Convert class indices to binary vectors
- **Benefit**: Compatible with softmax output and categorical crossentropy loss

#### 3. Data Augmentation (Advanced)
- **Rotation**: Rotate images slightly
- **Flip**: Horizontal/vertical flips
- **Zoom**: Scale images
- **Purpose**: Increase dataset diversity, reduce overfitting

## Model Architecture

### Our CNN Architecture
```
Input (32x32x3)
    ↓
Conv2D(32 filters, 3x3, ReLU) → (32x32x32)
    ↓
MaxPooling2D(2x2) → (16x16x32)
    ↓
Conv2D(32 filters, 5x5, ReLU) → (16x16x32)
    ↓
MaxPooling2D(2x2) → (8x8x32)
    ↓
Flatten() → (2048,)
    ↓
Dense(64, ReLU) → (64,)
    ↓
Dense(10) → (10,)
    ↓
Softmax() → (10,) [probabilities]
```

### Parameter Count
- **Total Parameters**: ~158,314
- **Trainable**: All parameters learn during training
- **Memory**: ~618KB model size

### Design Choices
- **Filter Sizes**: 3x3 (common patterns), 5x5 (larger features)
- **Filter Count**: 32 (balance between capacity and efficiency)
- **Dense Units**: 64 (sufficient for final classification)

## Training Process

### Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
```
Loss = -Σ(y_true * log(y_pred))
```
- **Purpose**: Measure difference between true and predicted probabilities
- **Goal**: Minimize this loss

### Optimizer: Adam
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts learning rate per parameter
- **Momentum**: Uses past gradients for smoother updates
- **Efficient**: Generally works well out-of-the-box

### Epochs
- **Definition**: One complete pass through entire training dataset
- **Typical Range**: 10-100 epochs
- **Monitoring**: Watch for overfitting after peak validation accuracy

### Batch Processing
- **Batch Size**: Number of samples processed together
- **Memory**: Larger batches need more GPU memory
- **Stability**: Larger batches provide more stable gradients

## Evaluation Metrics

### Accuracy
```
Accuracy = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions
```
- **Range**: 0-100%
- **Interpretation**: Percentage of correctly classified images
- **CIFAR-10 Baseline**: ~65-70% is good for simple models

### Loss
- **Training Loss**: How well model fits training data
- **Validation Loss**: How well model generalizes to unseen data
- **Ideal**: Both decrease together

### Confusion Matrix (Advanced)
- **Purpose**: Show which classes are confused with others
- **Diagonal**: Correct predictions
- **Off-diagonal**: Misclassifications

## Deployment Considerations

### Model Saving
```python
model.save('baseline_mariya.keras')  # Save entire model
```
- **Format**: Keras native format
- **Contents**: Architecture + weights + optimizer state

### Inference Pipeline
1. **Load Model**: `models.load_model()`
2. **Preprocess**: Resize, normalize input image
3. **Predict**: Get probability distribution
4. **Post-process**: Extract top prediction and confidence

### Performance Optimization
- **Model Quantization**: Reduce precision for faster inference
- **Pruning**: Remove unnecessary connections
- **Caching**: Store model in memory for repeated use

### Production Considerations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure for invalid inputs
- **Logging**: Track predictions and performance
- **Monitoring**: Watch for model drift over time
- **Security**: Validate uploaded files, prevent attacks
