Folks! in this repository you will slearn how to create a beautiful GUI application that can classify images of animals and vehicles!
<br>
In other words, an interface with a whole bunch of machine learning stuff!

## Starter Files

The starterFiles directory refers to the files required to follow my <a href="https://youtu.be/QYreI8wXGwE" target="_blank">video tutorial</a>.

## Complete Project

Includes the complete application, along with 2 jupyter notebooks that will help you design and customize your own image classifying neural networks.

## Requirements
- The interface of the app was designed with Taipy GUI: https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy
- The neural network used in the app was designed with Tensorflow: https://github.com/tensorflow
- The user provided images were loaded with Pillow: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow
- And Numpy was used to normalize those images: https://github.com/numpy/numpy
